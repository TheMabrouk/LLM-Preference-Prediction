# LLM Preference Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict which responses users will prefer in head-to-head battles between chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs). This work addresses a crucial aspect of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) by developing a preference model that can accurately predict human preferences between AI-generated responses.

## Data
The dataset comes from Chatbot Arena, where users chat with two anonymous LLMs and choose their preferred answer. The competition addresses known biases in preference prediction:
- Position bias (favoring responses presented first)
- Verbosity bias (favoring longer responses)
- Self-enhancement bias (favoring self-promoting responses)

## Approach

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution of user preferences
- Response length analysis
- Common linguistic patterns in preferred responses
- Topic modeling to identify content themes
- Position bias investigation

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Response statistical features (length, complexity, readability scores)
- Semantic similarity between prompt and responses
- Sentiment and emotional tone analysis
- Named entity recognition and knowledge integration metrics
- Response structure features (paragraphs, lists, code blocks)

### 3. Modeling Approaches
- **Baseline Models**: Logistic regression and random forests using engineered features
- **Embedding-based Models**: Using pre-trained embeddings (BERT, Sentence-BERT)
- **Fine-tuned Transformer Models**: Custom fine-tuning of smaller LLMs for preference prediction
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple model predictions for improved performance

### 4. Evaluation
- Primary metric: Log loss between predicted probabilities and ground truth
- Cross-validation strategy
- Bias analysis in model predictions
- Feature importance analysis
